# Gab Clone
Gab is an American alt-tech social networking service known for its far-right userbase. Widely described as a haven for extremists including neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white nationalists, the alt-right, and QAnon conspiracy theorists, it has attracted users and groups who have been banned from other social media platforms and users seeking alternatives to mainstream social media platforms.

We've cloned this website as a part of construct week project at Masai School. With a team of 4, we tried our best to make it look as exactly as original site and we also implimented a few important features, in just 5 days.

## Features 
- Signup and Sign in 
- Likes and comments for posts
- Following/unfollowing others
- Joining groups
- Searching for groups and people
- Responsive design
- Dark theme
- Chatting
